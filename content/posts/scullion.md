## Introduction to scullions

I recently finished reading [*Venomous Lumpsucker*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59593576-venomous-lumpsucker) by Ned Beauman, a sci-fi satire about climate change and species extinction. It's a great book and you should read it, but that's not the point of this post. Rather, I wanted to talk about an element in the story that is mentioned in passing, the *scullion*, which seems to be a kind of futuristic digital assistant that lives in the cloud, unique to every person.

> *When anyone else was listening his scullion was neutral and genderless, but
> in private it had the posh, breathy voice of a twenty-four-year-old girl
> with an expensive education.*

> *It was close to 4 a.m.
> His scullion was configured to wake him only when it had extremely
> important news.*

> *"Some major events, relevant to your interests, have taken place in the
> past hour." The scullion waking him [...]*

It occurred to me that this is a fascinating concept that would be useful for my own life (and of course, for others). I have a pretty busy schedule, managing university, work and personal commitments, and I often find myself struggling to keep track of new happenings. A scullion could help me stay on top of things. Furthermore, with the current state of AI, such a system seems feasible to implement.

Of course, this isn't a unique idea. In fact, there are many companies who have been established with the purpose of creating an autonomous digital assistant (but I think "scullion" sounds better, don't you?). In this post, I'll go through some currently available solutions, and also implement my own.

*Scullion*, from the late 15th century, means *a servant assigned the most menial kitchen tasks*. Hopefully ours will be more useful!
